 			<h2>Hi! I'm Daniel</h2>
			<p>
I'm a Colorado native: Boulder born, raised by the rough & tumble streets of Longmont, CSU educated, and I now reside in Denver. I had a brief stint in Florida for 2 years where I consulted for Accenture making tech dreams come true at the happiest place on earth.  After that, I put my Finance degree to work at Oracle where I quickly discovered Finance wasn't as thrilling as I expected, so I am happy to make a comeback to tech.

I am a fitness fanatic. I love tinkering with workout routines, exercises, pills, and powders to test results & gains. My favorite outdoors activities are hiking/camping, skiing, paddleboarding, and trail running.  I also just picked up sailing this last summer and I hope to spend much more time in 2016 out on Carter lake. I love animals. My life is currently dictated by a 9-lb cat named Muffins that is generous enough to let me live in her house.
