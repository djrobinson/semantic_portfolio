		<h2>My Goals for Galvanize</h2>
		
		<p>
		To start, I have a few reasons I wanted to join Galvanize:<br>
		
				-I have been self-teaching for 3	yrs with no outside help, and I'm thoroughly lost on where to go next<br>
				-Seeing the results of my work is important to me, which is something I can do with Code<br>
				-I have worked in PM and QA roles on Agile projects in the past and I felt like I had no idea what's going on due to lack of technical knowledge. I want to become more knowledgable, and not feel like this ever again:

		<p>
My goal for Galvanize it to gauge where I am at. Learning in a vacuum has left me without any input to my bad habits and gaps in knowlege.  I find that I'm naturally inclined to the back-end, and I would love to gain as much experience as I can with Node.js & other server side technologies over the 6 months. I have a deep passion for startups and fintech, but I would like to gain experience at a consultancy like Pivotal for a few years before embarking on my own.
